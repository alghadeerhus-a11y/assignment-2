# assignment-2

## Dataset Description
This project uses a dataset for introductory machine learning analysis.
The dataset contains multiple features (columns) and observations (rows)
that can be used to understand patterns and relationships in the data.

## Machine Learning Problem
The machine learning problem addressed in this assignment is a supervised
learning problem such as classification or regression.
The main goal of this assignment is to explore and understand the dataset
rather than build a complete machine learning model.
